            <a href="assign1/index.html">Assignment 1</a>
            <p>The initial assignment in our web page authoring course was a foundational exercise in understanding and applying the basics of web development. The primary objective was to familiarize ourselves with the fundamental components of web design, including the configuration of web accounts, the creation of directories, setting appropriate file permissions, and the process of uploading files to a server. This task required us to step away from the convenience of modern web authoring tools such as DreamWeaver, directing us instead to rely on more basic text editors like NotePad++ or TextWrangler. The rationale behind this approach was to immerse us in the nuts and bolts of web development, ensuring that we gained a hands-on understanding of the underlying processes.</p>
            <p>This experience was enlightening, offering a deep dive into the intricacies of web page creation. I learned about the various tags in HTML and how they form the skeleton of a web page. Understanding the structure of HTML was crucial, as it serves as the foundation upon which websites are built. Additionally, the assignment introduced me to the interaction between HTML and CSS, highlighting how CSS enhances the appearance of a web page. This practical exercise helped me appreciate the power of CSS in establishing the visual aesthetics of a site. Overall, the assignment was a valuable exercise in understanding the basics of web page authoring, laying a solid foundation for more advanced topics in web development.</p>
